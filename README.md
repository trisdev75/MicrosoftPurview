# Microsoft Purview

This project is dedicated to the articles I've written to help the community of administrators and engineers working with Microsoft Purview. 

Most of the problems I've encountered while working with Purview are poorly documented online, and most of them required extensive research as well as opening Microsoft support cases to resolve. My aim is to help the community by sharing solutions, workarounds and ideas, and thus bring my expertise to bear on these subjects.

I believe that by documenting these challenges and solutions, others in the community can benefit from the lessons learned and save time troubleshooting similar issues.

## Introduction
